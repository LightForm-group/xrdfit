abstract = {{\it FIT2D}~is one of the principal area detector data reduction, analysis and visualization programs used at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility and is also used by more than 400 research groups worldwide, including many other synchrotron radiation facilities. It has been developed for X-ray science, but is applicable to other structural techniques and is used in analysing electron diffraction data and microscopy, and neutron diffraction and scattering data. {\it FIT2D}~works for both interactive and `batch'-style data processing. Calibration and correction of detector distortions, integration of two-dimensional data to a variety of one-dimensional scans, and one- and two-dimensional model fitting are the main uses. Many other general-purpose image processing and image visualization operations are available. Commands are available through a `graphical user interface' and operations common to certain types of analysis are grouped within `interfaces'. Executable versions for most workstation and personal computer systems, and web page documentation, are available at http://www.esrf.eu/computing/scientific/FIT2D.},

Nuclear as well as magnetic structures can be refined, the latter only when their magnetic unit cell is equal to, or a multiple of, the nuclear cell. The least-squares refinement procedure allows, with a simple code, the introduction of linear or quadratic constraints between the parameters.},

year={2012},

abstract={A novel photon counting method for nonparalyzable counting and its implementation in the new PILATUS3 ASIC are presented. Pulse pile-up significantly affects the observed count rate at high photon fluxes in single-photon counting x-ray detectors and can lead to complete paralyzation of the counting circuit. In PILATUS single-photon counting hybrid-pixel x-ray detectors, count rate correction is applied in order to compensate for the counting loss at high count rates. However, counter paralyzation limits the maximum usable count rate of the PILATUS2 ASIC to typically 2.106 photons per second and pixel. In order to overcome this limitation, instant retrigger technology is introduced as a new photon counting method that results in non-paralyzable counting and achieves improved high-rate counting performance. Instant retrigger technology re-evaluates the pulse signal after a predetermined dead time interval after each count and potentially retriggers the counting circuit in case of pulse pile-up. The respective dead time interval is adjustable and accounts for the width of a single photon pulse. As a result, the counting becomes non-paralyzable and enhanced count rate correction can be applied in order to achieve improved data quality at high count rates. The new PILATUS3 ASIC features instant retrigger technology with adjustable dead time. The implementation of this new approach and experimental results are presented. The new ASIC additionally features counter overflow handling, improved pixel uniformity, reduced crosstalk, reduced readout time, and compatibility with CdTe sensors. With the new design, higher count rates can be measured and better data quality is achieved up to rates of more than 107 photons per second and pixel.},
