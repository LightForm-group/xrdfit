    "# 0. Introduction to fitting spectral data\n",
    "These tutorial notebooks will give a basic introduction to peak fitting of XRD scattering spectra using the the xrdfit package.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some example spectra can be found in the `example_data` folder in the root folder of the `xrd_fit` package and will be used here to demonstrate the various functions of the scripts. To use these notebooks you should proceed in order, executing each cell at a time, since some cells depend on variables defined in previous cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 0.1 Required packages\n",
    "\n",
    "If you installed `xrdfit` using pip all of these packages should already be installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "`xrdfit` uses the `lmfit` package to do the fitting: https://lmfit.github.io/. It also uses `Pandas` for loading data, `Numpy` for data processing, `matplotlib` for plotting, `dill` for saving fits to disk and `tqdm` for progress bars.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 0.2. Data format\n",
    "\n",
    "These scripts read data from text files. The format of the file is the standard format output by [DAWN](https://dawnsci.org/about/). DAWN is a data analysis and processing program commonly used for processing synchrotron data. An explanation of how to **cake** diffraction pattern images using DAWN is provided on our Research Group's Wiki page - [LightForm Wiki - DAWN Tutorial](https://lightform-group.github.io/wiki/tutorials/sxrd-caking). The text files can also be produced using a python script and the python package [pyFAI](https://pyfai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). An explanation of how to cake the data using pyFAI is also provided on our Wiki page - [LightForm Wiki - pyFAI Tutorial](https://lightform-group.github.io/wiki/tutorials/sxrd-caking-dioptas) and the scripts we use to do this are available on GitHub - [pyFAI caking script](https://github.com/LightForm-group/pyFAI-integration-caking).\n",
    "\n",
    "The data file does not have any column headings or title line. The first column of the data file is the two theta diffraction angle. Each subsequent column corresponds to a cake of intensity data from the diffraction pattern, starting with the first cake.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis we specify that a high-energy SXRD (synchrotron x-ray diffraction) experiment in transmission setup produces a circular **diffraction pattern**\n",
    "$$I = f(\\chi, 2\\theta)$$\n",
    "where $I$ is beam intensity, $\\chi$ is the azimuthal angle and $2\\theta$ is the scattering angle. The intensity is measured at a discreet number of azimuthal angles which results in the pattern being made up of a number of sectors which we call **cakes** (since the sectors look like a slice of cake).\n",

    "    \n",
    "By convention the **cakes** in the input data files are ordered clockwise starting with the first cake, although `xrdfit` can also handle data ordered anti-clockwise. However, no information is provided about the orientation of the first cake relative to \"up\" or North on a 2D projection. This means the angle of the first cake must be provided as part of the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 0.3. Peak model fit\n",
    "\n",
    "The model fit used in `xrdfit` is the Pseudo-Voigt (PV) model. This is a combination of a Gaussian and Lorentzian distribution function which is commonly used for the fitting of spectroscopic peaks since it is reliably robust to peak broadening. `xrdfit` uses the PV model from `lmfit` (https://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/builtin_models.html#pseudovoigtmodel). The model parameters are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* sigma $(\\sigma)$ - This controls the width of the fitted peak\n",
    "* fraction $(\\alpha)$ - The ratio of the Gaussian and Lorentzian components. \n",
    "* center $(\\mu)$ - The center of the fitted peak\n",
    "* amplitude ($A$) - The amplitude of the Gaussian and Lorentzian components\n",
    "* background - In addition to the PV parameters there is a constant background parameter to model the background detector noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three parameters which are derived from combinations of the above parameters:\n",
    "* Height - The y-value at the maximum of the fitted peak\n",
    "* FWHM - The full width at half maximum of the fitted peak\n",
    "* SNR - Signal to noise ratio - the peak height divided by the background"
