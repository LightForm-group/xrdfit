    "A key use for SXRD is monitoring the change in the structure of a material over time. If a number of diffraction patterns are collected over time `xrdfit` can be used to automatically fit the peaks and extract the changing fit parameters over time. The change in the positions or heights of the peaks can then be correlated to material properties. We call the fitting of multiple **spectra** an **Experiment**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example files folder there is a sequence of 10 diffraction patterns which we will use for demonstration. The workflow used in `xrdfit` assumes that the data are stored in sequentially numbered files, one spectrum per file, all in the same folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.1. Fitting a peak at multiple times\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind the time fitting in `xrdfit` is that you should be able to set up the peaks to fit for the first time step of the experiment and then run the fits automatically for the rest of the time steps, without manual intervention. The code will follow the changing positions of the peaks over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to fit peaks they must exist in the first frame of the fitting experiment. If certain peaks appear part way through an experiment then the spectrum will have to be fitted in parts, the appearing peaks being fitted only after they appear. As long as a peak exists at the start of the experiment, `xrdfit` should be able to cope with a peak disappearing for a time and reappearing later (an example is shown in tutorial notebook 4). If peaks merge together over time the behavior of `xrdfit` is not defined. In this case the fitting may need more manual adjustment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in setting up a multi-time fit is to load a `FitExperiment` object - this contains some metadata about the experiment and will hold one `FitSpectrum` for each diffraction pattern. The *first_cake_angle*, *cakes_to_fit*, *peak_params* and *merge_cakes* parameters are the same as previously defined. The *spectrum_time* parameter sets the number of seconds between each spectrum in the sequence - this value is used to appropriately label the time on the x-axis of plots. The *file_stub* parameter is used to locate the files for analysis. To use all of the spectra in a folder that are sequentially numbered - provide the stub of the file name with a star (wildcard).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the `FitExperiment` object is loaded, the `run_analysis` method runs the fit over all of the specified files."
